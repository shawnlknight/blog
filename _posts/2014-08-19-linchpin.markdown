I borrowed this title from Seth Godin's book, [Linchpin](http://www.amazon.com/Linchpin-Are-Indispensable-Seth-Godin/dp/1591844096). I didn't know what a linchpin was before I read this book but it is a pin that holds the wheel of a cart from coming off the axle. It is very small compared to the rest of the cart but it is vital to its functioning.
 
In his book, Seth describes how one must become a linchpin to become indispensable. It's about doing the right thing even when nobody is looking. It's about bringing passion to your work. 

I would say it is easier now to have this mindset and work ethic because everyone I work with at [Sparc](http://www.sparcedge.com/) have this same attitude. This wasn't so with some of my past jobs.

For the most part, people clocked in, did the bare minimum to not get fired, then clocked out. I could have easily had the same mindset. I had a college degree but was doing manual labor. I could have felt like the work was beneath me but I knew it was not the right thing to do.

I was lucky to have a father who taught me to give my best in what ever work I did. Whether that was washing dishes or moving furniture. I know that if I did not have that attitude I would have never of landed where I am today.
