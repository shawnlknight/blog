Recently at work we were tasked with logging goals we would like to achieve in the near future. I remember goal setting at some of my previous jobs and it was more of a hassle than anything else and the higher ups really didn’t care too much if you achieved those goals. However, at [Sparc][sparc] they really do want to see you grow as an employee and individual. Plus we used an awesome application called [Teamphoria][teamphoria] (built at Sparc) to set our goals. It was actually sort of fun doing it. 

Last year was a crazy year of change and challenges. I learned so much so fast that it was nice getting more into a rhythm this year. You have to be careful with rhythm though because you can become complacent and lose the drive to further yourself. So the act of setting goals helped realign me so that I don't fall into the pit of being too comfortable. 

###Professional Goals
One of my goals is to take some online classes, probably through something like [Treehouse][treehouse]. A lot of the material they offer is similar to what I've done in the past but it's never a bad idea to brush back up on those sorts of things. I also want to do more personal coding/side projects. I love that I get to code for work but I want to try out some new/different technologies we are not currently using on my project. Doing this will also keep me well rounded and in case I need to jump on other projects at work that are using other technologies/frameworks, I’ll be ready.

Another goal I have is to do something out of my comfort zone. I'm not a fan of public speaking and being in front of a crowd so when I was asked to be an emcee for an event I was of course hesitant and wanted to say no. The guys who contacted me about it were very encouraging about the whole thing. So I agreed and now I'm one of the emcees for the [Giant Conference][giant] that will be held here in Charleston in the middle of June. Still a little nervous about that one...

###Social/Family Goals
When I thought about goals for my social/family life, I thought of being *present*. Far too often we find ourselves more interested in what's happening on Facebook as opposed to talking to our coworker or talking with our family at dinner. We have a rule in our family where we put our phones away when we are spending time together, especially when we eat meals together. Sometimes I find myself pulling out my phone while my daughter is playing by herself but then she is great at bringing me back to reality with the simple question of, "Daddy, want to play with me?" How could I find someone else's perfectly frammed instagram photo more interesting than playing a game with my daugher? So another goal of mine is to spend even less time on social media and on my devices when I'm at home or spending time with friends.

###Personal Goals
I also have some personal goals related to fitness and health. I had a goal of doing a 5k race and recently did the [i5k][race] here in Charleston. I was happy finishing in 27 minutes, considering I only jog occasionally for warmups.

My main goal for fitness is to develop more strength. I’m doing a lot of barbell squatting, deadlifts, overhead presses, and some benching. I’ll throw in some power cleans and strict pull ups too but I’m not too concerned with the high energy metcons I did in CrossFit. My weakness has always been my strength. Now that I’m focusing on strength, I’ll test myself every once in a while with a more traditional CrossFit workout and I actually perform better than I did because the weights don’t seem as heavy as they used to.

It may sound crazy but one of the hardest things for me in my strength/size goal is the eating part of it. It’s hard to eat enough food to give my body what it needs to build more muscle. I was on a more paleo type of diet before and it’s great for getting ‘in shape’ but not so much when trying to gain muscle and size. So I’ve starting eating more carbs in the form of rice, quinoa, and oats.

I think another bad habit of mine is to stay up too late and not getting enough sleep. In order to fully recover from training I should be getting 8-9 hours of sleep. I wake up at around 5am, so that requires me to be in bed by 9pm. Sounds pretty early to most people but when I do get 8 hours of sleep I feel so much better the next day. 

I look forward to reaching my goals, whether professional or personal, and knowing that I have accountability through my work helps me stay focused on achieving them.
