We say we want the truth, that we want honesty. I mean, who enjoys to be lied to?

However, if you tell the truth, you are bound to piss someone off. You see, we say we want the truth but often the truth hurts. It’s uncomfortable and exposes us and no one wants to be exposed. 

That is sort of a conundrum isn’t it? You can either hide the truth or you can risk upsetting someone. You may even lose a relationship because of your honesty. 

But do you **REALLY** want to be in relationships based off of lies or half-truths? I sure don’t.

Holding back the truth is not being loving but you also want to make sure you are telling the truth out of love, not just to hurt someone.

I’d rather have brutal honesty than surface level interactions. Some people may think this is rude because they are not used to someone telling them what is really on their mind.
 
I think this is especially true in the south. You will find plenty of *nice* people who will straight up lie to your face. Got to love that southern charm!

I think in the end though, we would all be better off and in more fruitful relationships if we can be open and real with each other.
