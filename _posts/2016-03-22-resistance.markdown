If you haven't read *The War of Art* by Steven Pressfield, then stop right now and go do that!

You won't regret it.

If you have read it, then you'll know what **The Resistance** is.

I battle with it consistently. It often wins. It's a beast that seeks to destroy me.

> “The most important thing about art is to work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying.” - Steven Pressfield, *The War of Art*

The Resistance is largely responsible for my [impostor syndrome](http://shawnleberknight.com/blog/impostor-syndrome). It wants me to feel inadequate.

It also loves when I'm comfortable. Staying comfortable will bring death. Mental death. Physical death. They can both come from leading idle lives.

Who wants that?  

### Busyness Trap

We could *say* that we don't that but do our actions back that up? Are we cutting out the waste in our lives? Are we burdened with busyness?

Resistance wants us to feel busy without accomplishing anything of worth. It allows us to create **garbage**. Not art.

It loves for us to run around in circles.

You've got to kill it. Don't listen to comfort. Do the meaningful work.

You'll be better off.
