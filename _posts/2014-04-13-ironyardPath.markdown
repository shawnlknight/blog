Getting out of your comfort zone is hard and not the path most of us choose to take. We like predictable outcomes and the safety that accompanies them. The problem with that sort of life is that it is really boring!

Great things in life come with a risk of failure and defeat. When you take a chance, there is no guarantee that everything will work out. In fact, it probably won’t work out perfectly like you hoped for. If you look at the great men and women throughout history you will see that they all took the road less traveled.

Most of my career I’ve taken the predictable path. You know what I found? Those paths are usually very disappointing. I want more out of life than ordinary. I don’t regret getting a four year degree but it hasn’t really brought me what I hoped for. The traditional route isn’t for me. I wasn’t made to wake up and do that same boring work day in and day out. Doing so makes me feel as though I’m wasting away.

I need to be challenged and stretched. I need to work with people who feel the same. People who think outside of the box and like to challenge the status quo.

I found exactly that when I stumbled upon The Iron Yard coding school. At first, I passed on the idea that I could become a programmer and completely change my career path. But something told me to look further and dig a little deeper. The funny thing was, I was actually teaching myself how to code last fall and really enjoyed it. I thought it would be a cool hobby and maybe make some extra money on the side. To pursue this new life, I had to take a huge leap of faith. I had to quit my job in order to accommodate a full-time, 3 month intensive course. “Rational” thinking would have said to forget about it and stay at my company. My company afforded safety and guarantee, after all.

I had an unexplainable force urging me to take this leap and go all in. The best part about it is my wife is fully supportive of this venture. Now, here I am after week two of school and I have no regrets WHAT SO EVER!
