If you’ve been following me on twitter, you’ve probably seen me post about CrossFit (a lot). I even built a [CrossFit](https://shawn-final.firebaseapp.com/#/) app for my final project at the Iron Yard. A common complaint about people who crossfit is how much they talk about it. Yes, sometimes we get carried away and I know that you probably don’t care what my Fran time is. However, you cannot deny the positive impact CrossFit or things like the Spartan Race have on our culture. You also cannot deny the health problems in this country that stem from unhealthy eating and living sedentary lives. So why do people get so upset when someone is excited about changing their lives for the better through exercise and healthy eating? 

####Convenience

Our culture looks for convenience in everything we do. We look for the easy way out. We choose the elevator instead of the stairs. We choose the drive-thru instead of planning out our meals. Exercising isn’t a walk in the park either. After a long day at work, it’s not easy to be motivated to go for a run or go to the gym. I love CrossFit but I don’t always feel like doing a metcon in Charleston’s hot humid summers but I know what the alternative outcome can be.

There’s nothing convenient about being unhealthy though. I used to be the fat kid whose favorite activity was watching movies and eating a bowl of oreos with milk like it was cereal. I remember what it was like running out of breath walking up a flight of stairs. I remember fearing gym class because I couldn’t do a pull up or run a mile. I remember not sleeping well at night from being hopped up on Mountain Dew. There was nothing convenient about any of that. I never want to go back to that state of living.

####No Time

We also make excuses about not having enough time. Which isn’t true in the least. It’s about priority. I know plenty of people with this excuse who also watch two or more hours of television at night. Time that could be used planning meals or exercising. Next time you have five minutes, set a timer and do as many burpees as you can in those five minutes. Tell me that won’t get you sweating and your heart rate up!

####For My Family

For me, eating right and staying fit is more than just about me. I want to be healthy for my family. I don’t want them to have to take care of me because of a disease I gained from unhealthy living. I want to be strong enough to carry my loved ones out of a burning building if I had to. I want to be fast enough to rescue my child if they run out into a busy road. I want to have the energy to go out and play baseball or kickball with my kids. I surely don’t want my kids running circles around me.

I think if we evaluate how our lifestyle is effecting ourselves and our loved ones than we can be provoked to want to change for the better.

What’s stopping you from changing your life?
