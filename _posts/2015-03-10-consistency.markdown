> Consistency is key.

I’m sure you’ve heard this saying before. Sounds great at face value but consistency can be a double-edged sword.

Think about it…You can be consistently awful at something. Consistently late, consistently overeat, consistently forget important dates (Anniversary anyone?).

Here’s an example: We have all have witnessed the parent in the department store give in to their crying child and buy them the toy they want just to shut them up. That child will learn to use his parent’s consistency to his advantage. I’m by no means a great parent and don’t have that much experience but I do know that will not turn out well in the long run.

Consistently doing the best you can is definitely not easy and you won’t always get recognition for it but you will know you gave it your all. The real key is hard work and persistence.

I try to take this advice in my career. I want to consistently do great work and not fall into the trap of ‘good enough.’ Mediocre is no where near fulfilling and not worth the regret that will inevitably come.
