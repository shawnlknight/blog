### Here is a random list of things I do not like
- Spring (i.e., *evil* pollen)
- Game invites on Facebook (Seriously who in the hell plays those games?)
- Soda (I can think of better ways to slowly kill myself)
- Talking about sports (Love the food at football parties though)
- When someone calls me "brother" when, in fact, I'm not their brother
- Political yard signs all over the damn place
- Staying up past 10pm (Ok, more like 9pm)
- Reply All emails (**STOP** doing this!)
- Most things labeled as "Christian" (music, art, etc...)
- The phrase, "Doing life together" (Really any **Christianese** phrases bug the shit out of me)
- People saying I don't need to watch what I eat or exercise because I'm already fit...(How do people think you get fit in the first place?)
