I’m on the outside looking in.

Looking into the monstrosity that we’ve created.

There is good. There is bad.

We can celebrate the good but cannot question the bad. Unless, of course, you are one of authority and influence. Leave that to the Professionals.

There is claim to love others and that love is the motivation. When questioned, though, the outsiders are called melancholic complainers who don't want responsibility. There is no reason to see their side of things. There is no hope for them.

There is good but there is bad.

We cannot overlook the bad. We cannot outcast a substantial amount of people who no longer agree with the Professionals.

Some simply do not want to continue this cycle of consumerism that can dull us from the inside out. The cycle that keeps us in groups that look and think alike. The cycle that keeps us walled out from the questioners.

There are those who will never step inside of your four walls. What do you do with them?

Are the outsiders not worth it? Do you not loose sleep over them?

Love the good. Question the bad.
