One thing ~~all~~ most humans have in common is how we portray ourselves differently depending on who we are interacting with. In his *The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life*, sociologist Erving Goffman calls this "front stage” behavior. Goffman uses theater imagery in his explanation of human interaction. Humans, like actors, portray a certain identity to their audience and would never reveal their true selves to said audience.

This “true self” is only allowed to come out in the back stage. This is where we are free to express our deepest darkest feelings and thoughts. You may allow parts of your true self to be seen by a select few but the only place we ever show 100% is when we are alone.

You probably have multiples roles you "play" throughout the day:
- Work Self
- Family Self
- Friend Self
- True Self

These roles probably have crossovers but are definitely different.

I’m not advocating we act the exact same at work as we do at home. That could certainly be inappropriate. You probably don't want to spill your life problems to the clerk at the gas station or the UPS driver delivering your Amazon package. However, you should be able to open up to close friends and family. 

I also think it's good to open up to people you consider good comrades at work. If you sit next to someone for 8 hours a day, why wouldn't you want to learn more about them and what's going on in their life? 

I’m tired of surface level interaction. I’m tired of hearing that everyone is “good.” How in the world can every person be “good” all the time? We are behaving more like robots with pre-programed responses. 

```javascript
function humanInteraction() {
  if ($(“.humanSays’).val() == "How are you?") {
    alert("Good, how are you?")
  }
}
```

I get that it’s not realistic to have a lengthy conversation with every person you interact with but for goodness sake can’t we be a little more honest and open with people?
