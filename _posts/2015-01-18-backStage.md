One thing ~~all~~ most humans have in common is how we portray ourselves differently depending on who we are interacting with. In his *The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life*, sociologist Erving Goffman calls this "front stage” behavior. Goffman uses theater imagery in his explanation of human interaction. Humans, like actors, portray a certain identity to their audience and would never reveal their true selves to said audience.

This “true self” is only allowed to come out in the back stage. This is where we are free to express our deepest darkest feelings and thoughts. You may allow parts of your true self to be seen by a select few but the only place we ever show 100% is when we are alone.

I’m not advocating we say out loud every thought we have to just anyone. That would certainly be inappropriate. Your workplace is probably not the best place to do so but in front of your close friends or spouse should be a place where you can be yourself. You should be able to open up to them and share who you really are.

I’m tired of surface level interaction. I’m tired of hearing that everyone is “good.” How in the world can every person be “good” all the time? We are behaving more like robots with pre-programed responses. 

```javascript
function humanInteraction() {
  if ( $(“.humanSays’).val() == "How are you?") {
    alert("Good, how are you?")
  }
}
```

I get that it’s not realistic to have a lengthy conversation with every person you interact with but for goodness sake can’t we be a little more honest with people?
