It’s easy to find amazing websites these days with well thought out layouts, the latest animations, and responsive design. 

What’s still hard to find are sites that are accessible to visually impaired users.

Here’s a test, try to get to all the relevant information on your site using just the keyboard and by tabbing to all the elements. Successful? If not, then you cut out a lot of visually impaired users who may try to use your site/app. 

It wasn’t until my current role that I came to realize how much is involved in making an application useable to the visually impaired. Being on a government contract, we have to certify that our app is accessible to these users. Look up [section 508][508] and you can read all about it. 

Designing for 508 compliance isn’t the most exciting part of my job (try listening to a screen reader for hours on end!) but it has made me approach design with more simplicity and structure.

Here are just a few things to consider when designing your site for these users:

- Proper html structure
- Alt tags for images
- Incorporate tab index 
- Have enough contrast for elements that portray important information
- Become familiar with [WAI-ARIA][aria] 

Also, check out [WebAIM][webAim] for a great accessibility checklist.
