More than likely you have made a New Year's resolution. Maybe you decided to eat better or exercise more. We all see the posts on social media about how this year will be the one where we drastically change how we live. Well, I didn’t set out to do this in 2014 but that’s exactly what happened. 

##Background

Let me back up to the year 2013. I was in my 4th year working in logistics as a warehouse specialist. I liked many aspects of my job but I had come to the point where I wasn’t really being challenged anymore. However, I was a little too comfortable and it was easy to go with the flow of life. Then, the government shutdown happened. Government employees were back payed for all of that mess but contractors, like me, were not. Time to do something different.

During the shutdown I applied to countless jobs. It would be about a month before I finally heard back from one, a local software company. I was super excited and I knew some people who worked there so I got a good feel about the company. I had my interview early in November. I thought it went very well and was told I would hear back soon. December came but no word yet.

After three weeks I gave up on the thought of changing careers and settled back into my warehousing job. It was getting close to Christmas when I received a call one day on my way to pick up my daughter from daycare. It was the software company offering me the position I had interviewed for. I can remember thinking about turning it down. I’m not sure exactly why I considered that. Here was my opportunity for a change and a new adventure and I seriously thought about staying in warehousing. What was I thinking? 

Anyways, I talked it over with my wife and we decided it was a good idea for me to take the offer. It was actually really hard giving my notice at my warehousing job. I had been there for a long time and formed a lot of relationships. Most people were happy for me and supportive and I’ll never forget all the lessons I learned at that job.

##New Job

I was excited to dive into some different work that would stretch and challenge me. I was hired as a data analyst and quickly found out how important this job is at this particular company. My team was compromised of smart, hard working people. They were all very helpful in getting me acclimated to my tasks. 

My previous job didn’t require much computer time, and although I was proficient at using one, I was no where near an expert and had to learn many new tools and terms. I quickly became fascinated by the software I was using to complete my work, which would eventually contribute to my next big life decision. 

I’m not one to complain about hard work or having to put in overtime every now and then but it was happening more often and I was seeing my family less and less. At first, I thought it would get better as I got more proficient at my tasks, but the workload kept increasing. My whole team seemed to put in long hours. It was the nature of the the work we did. Luckily, there was plenty of free coffee to keep me going.

Everyday I seemed to get home later and a lot more responsibility was falling on my wife to take care of things at the house. I didn’t like this at all. I had all but stopped working out and I was sitting down all day. Going from a very laborious job to this was a very drastic change and hard to adjust to. This added even more stress. 

I started thinking I made the wrong decision switching jobs. But I kept reminding myself that I was going nowhere at my old job and that at least I would have opportunities for promotion or moving into a different role at this company. At what cost though? My health. My time with family. Seeing daylight?

Something had to change. I was getting into a very dark place mentally. 

##A Bright Light

One evening I noticed on Facebook that a friend/neighbor of mine had starting working for a place called [The Iron Yard][ironYard]. The name of the place intrigued me so I looked it up online. Their website says they can teach you programming in three months and help you find a job. Sounded a little unbelievable and I was skeptical but interested. I had actually started trying to teach myself basic web development using free programs online back around the time of the government shutdown. I really enjoyed it but stopped because I didn’t have much free time anymore. 

I wondered if there was a way I could do this coding school but in order to, I would have to quit my job and rely on my wife’s sole income to take care of us. **No way** I thought. I mentioned it to my wife briefly thinking she would also say it was too crazy, but to my surprise, she was really interested in it. She knew I enjoyed web design and wanted to learn more so she encouraged me to contact our neighbor about it. 

Our neighbor, Sally, is the director of the Charleston campus for the Iron Yard. We invited her over for a drink and to talk about the program. She described how awesome it was and how it was changing people’s lives. She was very convincing and told me she thought I would do great in the program.

I was still a little hesitant about going back to school though. Since I graduated college, I had never been unemployed and it scared the *shit* out of me. I can only say that it was God who eventually gave me and my wife a peace about pursing this undertaking. Others thought I was little crazy to do this and I couldn’t blame them.

So here I was, putting my notice in at this software company after only three months. I know, not a very long run. However, I was met with support from my team and even told to keep in touch because they were always looking for programming talent! This was a good sign and gave me some relief on my decision.

##Back to School

There is no amount of preparation I think I could of done to help me realize what I had gotten myself into. Those online programming schools only skim the surface of being a computer engineer. I won’t go into too much detail because I’ve written about some of my experiences earlier in my [blog][blogPost1]. But I will say it was the hardest, most challenging, most rewarding endeavor I’ve ever undertaken (except for convincing my wife to like me when we first met, but that’s another story). There were a multitude of times I thought I wouldn’t make it through the course. I was told the *fever* would break about halfway through the course. It did, and I started believing that I could actually make it as a computer engineer. 

I cannot tell you how excited I was and overwhelmed with pure joy at the end of the course when multiple software companies in Charleston (including my previous employer) wanted to interview me for a programmer position. With the help of the awesome people at The Iron Yard and the support of my lovely wife, I had completely change my career and life in three months! **Crazy!**.

##Dream Job

You may have read my earlier [post][blogPost2] about this but I choose to go with a fantastic company called [Sparc][sparc]. I started July 14, 2014 as a *UI/UX Engineer* for one of the fastest growing software companies in the nation and I had only been programming for a few months. This was **insane!** 

Here it is January of 2015. I don’t get the case of the Mondays anymore, I love going into my job everyday, and I get to work with some of the best people on earth. The Iron Yard definitely gave me a solid foundation for programming but I’m continually learning from my peers. The wonderful thing about this field is that you will always be learning and growing. It never ends.

Like I said, I didn’t plan on completely changing my life in 2014 but that's exactly what happened.
