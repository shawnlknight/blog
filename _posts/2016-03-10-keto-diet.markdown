I’ve been trying out the [keto](http://www.ruled.me/guide-keto-diet/) diet for about week now. If you aren’t familiar ketosis, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis), it "is a metabolic state in which most of the body's energy supply comes from ketone bodies in the blood, in contrast to a state of glycolysis in which blood glucose provides most of the energy.”

Basically, you keep your carb/sugar intake to lower than 50g a day and your body will start to produce ketones to burn for energy instead of the glucose that is produced from carbs/sugar. The ketones come from your fat stores.

## You eat fat?!?
So what do I get to eat on this diet? **FAT**!

Yes, you get to eat a lot of fat. Guess what? Fat does not make you fat. Eating the typical American diet of carbs will. I’ve been eating a little under 3,000 calories a day with the majority of those calories coming from fat and most of the rest from protein. The reason for all the calories is I'm also trying to build muscle. It will definitely take me longer to build muscle this way but it'll help ensure I'm not also adding fat.

## Downsides
I’m fine with giving up bread and potatoes and such but giving up fruit has been pretty hard. I love fruit but there is so much sugar in it that it’s off limits for the most part. Especially my favorite...bananas.

You can also get the [“keto flu”](http://www.tasteaholics.com/keto-diet/what-is-keto-flu-how-to-help/) for a few days as your body adjusts to burning ketones. Your body is basically in a state of shock because it’s reversing how you burn energy. I had pretty bad headaches and low energy levels for a couple of days but I’m feeling back to normal now. Plus, I'm already starting to notice a difference in how I feel (great!) and how my clothes fit!

We’ll see if this diet is worth it and *maintainable* though.
