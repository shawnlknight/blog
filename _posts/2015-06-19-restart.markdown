Most of us remember having to restart our computers or video game consoles because they were working slow or just stopped all together. It was like magic. You hit reset and all of a sudden everything is back to normal. Usually.

Sometimes we get bogged down and sluggish too. Sometimes we need a restart.

It's a little more complicated restarting our system than it is a computers. Well, it takes more effort on our parts at least.

Getting into a relaxed state is a good place to start. We need to remove ourselves from the problems of the day.

I've heard it said that if you have a physically intense job, it helps to relax by working your brain. For me, when I was doing logistics and manual labor, I would relax by reading or by practicing some coding online.

I've also heard that if your job is more mentally intense, it can help to do something physical to calm down and relax. This is definitely true for me now that I spend the majority of my day on a computer. The afternoons that I get to load up a barbell in my garage and squat are the times I feel the most refreshed.

It's a cleansing ritual for me. I sleep better at night. I wake up refreshed and ready for what the day has to bring.

The important thing is to find what works for you.

Find a way to restart your system.
