Each day you have a choice. You can choose to make the most of the day or you can waste it.

You can enjoy each moment or to let time pass by while you stare like a zombie at social media.

You can eat healthy and exercise or you can choose to make your body sick.

Itâ€™s all in our choices. We are not promised tomorrow but we should also be cognizant that the choices we make today will affect our future.

I, for one, want to have a better tomorrow. For myself and for those I care about.
