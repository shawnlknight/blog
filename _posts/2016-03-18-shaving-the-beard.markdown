So I'm going to shave my beard off...

No. Not really. I love my beard! It's apart of who I am.

Some people still ask me, "When are you going to get rid of the beard?" It's always a strange question because it's not like I grew it for no-shave November. I've had it for years. Since about 2005 actually. You could say my beard is **old school**.

I guess there is a backlash to the beard culture that has cropped up over the past few years. 

Want to know the last time I shaved my beard? 

It was 2012! And by "shaved" I don't mean neatly trimmed. I mean all-out shaved my face with a razor and cream. It sucked. I nicked the crap out myself.

I also look like I'm 16 years old when I shave.

Why did I shave it? If you can believe it, I was thinking of becoming a police officer. Not that it's a bad thing to be a police officer but looking back I can say I would have made a terrible cop. Glad that didn't work out.

However, at the time, I was quite upset about not getting the opportunity to be an officer. I had shaved my face for nothing!

### Finding the Good
Something good did come out of it though. 

I figured I should prepare for the physical test they give to be accepted into the police academy. I had heard from a friend that CrossFit was great for first responders.

I was very nervous my first time going in to the CrossFit gym because I had watched videos of all the crazy stuff they do. I didn't know what to expect. 

What I found was an awesome community of supportive people with the same goals.

I also found out how weak and unfit I really was. 

I may have looked in shape (if you can call skinny bird-man looking "in shape") from all the long-distance cycling but at the time I couldn't even squat my bodyweight. I also had lower back issues and I'm sure being in a bent-over position on a bike didn't help. 

I instantly became hooked on CrossFit. I "drank the cool-aid" as some people say. The reason I fell in love with it so fast was the community. The people are what makes CrossFit so awesome. 

Over time, I developed some great relationships and also became stronger and healthier. My low back does not hurt anymore. Who knew deadlifts could help your back by strengthening it? I've also learned how important nutrition is to fueling your body (This plays into my eating [3,000](http://shawnleberknight.com/blog/3000) calories a day).

I'm not able to go to the CrossFit gym as much these days but I have taken what I've learned and applied it to my training at home. Definitely not the same, especially without the community, but that's how it is right now in this stage of life.

**Back to my beard...** People who know me, know I love my beard. Many of them have never seen me clean shaven and I vow to never shave it off again! Although, if shaving it brought me to CrossFit, then I'm glad I did it.
