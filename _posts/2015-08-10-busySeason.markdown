I haven’t posted to my blog in a while and one reason is that life has been fairly busy.

On a given day, I might say I am busy, because I, like many others, default to that answer. It makes us sound more important than we really are doesn't it? I am trying not to say that as much because it bothers me. Same with how we all say we are *good* even when life is shitty.

However, I’m serious this time about being busy.

You see, my wife just had our second daughter on July 14th and our world has been flipped upside down. You might say, “Don’t you have another daughter? Aren’t you used to all of that?” Well kind of.

Our first daughter, if you don’t already know, was adopted. Which, was actually just finalized June 24th of this year. Thank God for that! We’ve only been waiting about 3 years.

Some people didn’t realize our first daughter wasn’t a baby when she first came to us. She was already 14 months and sleeping through the night. So this whole hungry baby who doesn’t sleep at night thing is new to my wife and I.

I can’t really complain though. I get to sleep in another room to have the energy to go to work the next day and take care of our eldest daughter. My wife is the one waking up every two and a half hours to feed the screaming baby. 

I’ve heard it’s not that easy to add a second kid into the mix but not knowing what sleep deprivation is like and you are in a whole new league of scary!

I must say, I’m very thankful that my job allowed me to take two weeks of leave and then a third week of working from home to help my wife out. That would of never of happened at any of my last jobs.

My wife is also pretty lucky to be able to take twelve weeks off. It’s sad to hear how many women don’t get nearly that amount. Twelve weeks isn’t even that much. It flies by.

Isn’t it crazy that the U.S. and Papua New Guinea are the ONLY countries among 185 nations and territories that have not imposed government-mandated laws requiring employers to pay mothers who are on leave with their babies?

Good job Merica...

It’s refreshing to see companies like [Netflix](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/08/netflix-parental-leave/400541/) allowing employees, women and men, to take a year off with pay if they so choose, with the birth or adoption of a child. I’m not saying every company should do this but it would be nice to see changes that allow women and men in the workforce to have more time off with pay when they have a baby or adopt.

Anyways, all that to say that we are sort of in survival mode right now. Living day by day. It’s not the easiest season but having the little one added to our family is definitely a blessing.
