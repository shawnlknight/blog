When was the last time you had a planned meeting where the other party was late? I bet you were upset, feeling like your time was wasted. You may have felt it was rude and inconsiderate.

###Life Happens
There are times when one cannot help but being late. Maybe there was an accident on the highway or your child peed his/her pants that caused a delay. I get that. Life happens. Having a kid now has taught me that you can never expect the unexpected and you are going to be late every now and then because of it.

But we all know a few people in our circle of life who are consistently late to everything. You know to tell them to meet you earlier than you really have to because they are guaranteed not to show up on time. Some of the people I know like this don't have kids and are not married. They only have themseleves to worry about but they still seem to arrive fashionably late.

###Respect
To me, this comes down to respect. If you respect someone, then you will do what you can to be on time. Life will always have the unexpected so maybe do your best to leave early. There’s nothing wrong with being a little early to a meeting but do not waste another person’s time because you hit the snooze button a few too many times.
