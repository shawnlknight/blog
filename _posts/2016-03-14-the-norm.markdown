Social norms are a funny thing.

As long as you follow along with them you be *ok* (i.e., you will fit in). 

Humans like to create exclusive groups that huddle around common norms and values. They keep us comforable. We toss aside anything uncomfortable. 

You can stay in the group as long as you don't think differently. Question the norm, though, and you may find yourself outcasted.

I might question the norm too often...
