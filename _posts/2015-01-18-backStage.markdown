One thing most humans have in common is how we portray ourselves differently depending on who we are interacting with. 

In his *The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life*, sociologist Erving Goffman calls this "front stage” behavior. Goffman uses theater imagery in his explanation of human interaction. Humans, like actors, portray a certain identity to their audience and would never reveal their true selves to said audience.

This “true self” is only allowed to come out in the backstage. This is where we are free to express our deepest darkest feelings and thoughts. You may allow parts of your true self to be seen by a select few but the only time we ever show 100% is when we are alone.


###Multiple Roles
You probably have multiples roles you play throughout the day:

- Spouse/significant other
- Parent
- Friend 
- Coworker

These roles have crossovers but are definitely different in certain respects.

You probably wouldn't want to spill your life problems to the clerk at the gas station or the UPS driver delivering your Amazon package. However, you should be able to open up and be yourself to close friends and family. 

I also think it's healthy to open up at work to people you consider good comrades. If you are going to sit next to someone for 8 hours a day, why wouldn't you want to share some of your life with them and vice versa? This could help your work atmosphere by investing in people rather than just your tasks.

###Robots
But we are so guarded. We are afraid of what people will think of us. We hide behind surface level conversations. Think about your typical interactions and how they usually play out,

> Coworker: Hey how are you?

> You: Good, how about you?

> Coworker: I'm good.

Is it possible for so many people to be *good* all of the time? We are behaving more like robots with pre-programed responses. 

~~~javascript
function humanInteraction() {
  if ($(".humanSays").val() == "How are you?") {
    alert("Good, how are you?");
  }
}
~~~

I am guilty of doing this but I'm trying to be more honest with people. If I'm not having that great of a day, why lie to someone about it? I get that it’s not realistic to have a lengthy conversation with every person you interact with and you don't want to have a pity party everyday but can we be a little more honest with people we see on a regular basis? 

I suggest we allow our audience to see more of our backstage self and start getting real with people we care about.
