I broke up with Facebook this week. 

I disabled my account actually. I was too paranoid that Facebook was collecting and selling all of my information.

Okay, that's not really the the reason (even though they do that). The real reason is I needed a break from it all.

You see, I can be an asshole ~~sometimes~~ and am a professional at starting firestorms on Facebook.

Facebook ***should*** be used to share photos and keep up with friends but there are a lot of us who use it to share our thoughts/rants on stuff like politics and religion. The old saying of how one should never discuss politics or religion at the dinner table rings true for the internet. 

Too much can be lost in translation and it’s too easy to assume things. You can also do what I did and get a lot of people mad at you.

I need to learn to keep my mouth shut on the internet and to discuss my thoughts face to face. That way, if I anger you, you can actually punch me in the face instead of just wishing you could through your computer screen. 

Just kidding.

So don’t worry, I didn’t unfriend you. I unfriended Facebook.

It actually felt really good. It was like a weight had been lifted off of me. I was spending way too much time on there anyways.

Now I just have to be careful not to make the same mistake with Twitter...
