Do you ever feel like you are drifting through your life on autopilot?

I feel like this sometimes during the work week. It’s as if I have tunnel vision to everything I’m not actively involved in.

Most of us love our routines though. We don’t like surprises. It’s easier that way.

I wonder how much we miss living life like this? Missed opportunities and moments that could drastically impact our lives. Maybe for the worse but probably for the better.

Something that helps me is to take a few walks outside during the day to clear my mind. Even using a slightly different route to work can help break me out of my routine.

The other day I decided to stop at a coffee shop on the way into work, which I never do because it isn’t part of my routine, but I actually ran into a couple people I hadn’t seen in a long time. It was nice catching up even if it was just for a few minutes.

Maybe turn off your autopilot and try something a little different today.
