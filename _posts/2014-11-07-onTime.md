When was the last time you had a planned meeting where the other party was late? I bet you were upset, feeling like your time was wasted. You may have felt it was rude and inconsiderate.

####Life Happens

There are times when one cannot help but being late. Maybe there was an accident on the highway or your child peed his/her pants and that caused a delay. I get that. Life happens. 

But we all know a few people in our circle of life who are consistently late to everything. You know to tell them to meet you earlier than you really have to because they are guaranteed to be late.

If you don’t know anyone that does this, then you may be that person who is always late.

####I'm Sorry
It's really hard for me to accept an apology from a person who is consistently late. Usually I won't say, "It's okay." What I usually say is, "Oh...ok." What I really want to say is how much their lateness bothers me. But maybe I'm just being too nice. 

####Respect

To me, this comes down to respect. If you respect someone, then you will do what you can to be on time. But do not aim only to be on time because life will have the unexpected. Do your best to leave early. There’s nothing wrong with being a little early to a meeting but do not waste another person’s time because you hit the snooze button a few too many times.
