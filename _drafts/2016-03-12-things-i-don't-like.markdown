### Here is a random list of things I do not like
- Spring (because of the *evil* pollen)
- Game invites on Facebook
- Soda (La Croix is not soda!)
- Talking about sports
- Political signs all over the damn place
- Staying up past 10pm (More like 9pm. I'm an old soul.)
- Reply all emails (Seriously, **STOP** doing this!)
-
